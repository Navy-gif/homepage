      <h4> Hi! </h4>

      <p>
        I'm Navy, or Erik. I'm a 20-something year old software developer from Finland. I don't really do designâ„¢, so excuse the oddly themed page (it's also probably unfinished).
      </p>

      <p>
        I like to volunteer some of my free time in online communities both as a moderator as well as a bot developer and maintainer.
        My longest running project is a Discord bot named <a href='https://galactic.corgi.wtf'>Galactic</a> that I was invited to join in 2016 and have been maintaining and developing since.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        On top of software development I enjoy playing vidya, of which I may occasionally post clips in the media page on this site.
        Beyond that there isn't much else to know about me, am simple man.
      </p>
